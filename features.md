## **Timeline/Gantt View**
**Basic idea:** Visualize tasks on a horizontal timeline with draggable bars representing duration.

**What you'll add:**
- Start date & end date fields for each task
- Visual bars showing task duration
- Timeline scaling (days/weeks/months)
- Drag to adjust dates directly on timeline

**Library options:**
1. **Frappe Gantt** (lightweight, simple)
2. **React Gantt Timeline** (more features)
3. **DIY with CSS Grid/Flexbox** (good learning)

**Core concept:** Convert task dates to horizontal positions, render bars proportionally to timeline.
