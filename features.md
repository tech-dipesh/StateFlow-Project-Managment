✅ First: Answering Your Question Directly
Yes.

The filter logic you’ve built is EXACTLY what I meant by MVP #5.

So let’s lock this in clearly:

🧱 WHAT YOU HAVE COMPLETED (Locked & Done)

You have now built ALL core MVP features.

✅ MVP #1 – Task lifecycle

Create → update → change status → persist
✔️ DONE

✅ MVP #2 – Board logic

Status-driven grouping
✔️ DONE

✅ MVP #3 – Task details / editing

Per-task updates
✔️ DONE

✅ MVP #4 – List View

Same data, table format
✔️ DONE

✅ MVP #5 – Filters

Filter tasks by status
✔️ DONE

This is not small.
This is already a usable project management system.






🥇 1. Activity Log (Highest ROI — Build First)
