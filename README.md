  - Also unable to do the event delegation on the parent.
  - Make the default value of the input
  - Make the event delegation is user is cick outside not showa input button
  - Controlled input default input value fix.
  - during the setLocalStorage hoooks, i've facwe as soon as it's rerender that function it setting duplicate values.
    - It's due to the prev spread operator
  - as i've face the duplicate entreis, which i can solve with the check on array which have duplicate just update that.
  - i'm doing the overenginneing on the filter option which i fix now.
